*Certificate Issued - 

# Project Description:
Student Enrollment Form that will store data in STUDENT-TABLE relation of SCHOOL-DB database.
Input Fields: {Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, Enrollment-Date} having Primary key: Roll No.

Introducing a Student Enrollment Form that can efficiently store data in the STUDENT-TABLE relation of the SCHOOL-DB database. This form is designed to provide users with a seamless data entry experience, as it comes equipped with various input fields, including Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, and Enrollment-Date.
Moreover, to ensure optimal functionality, the Roll-No field is set as the primary key, thereby allowing for quick and easy retrieval of information. This feature eliminates the need for users to navigate through large datasets to locate specific information, making data management more efficient and streamlined.
By utilizing this Student Enrollment Form, educational institutions can maintain accurate and up-to-date student records with ease. The form's user-friendly interface and efficient data storage capabilities make it an excellent tool for ensuring the smooth functioning of educational institutions.
In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient method to store student data, look no further than the Student Enrollment Form. Its convenient input fields, coupled with the optimized primary key, make it an excellent choice for educational institutions seeking to streamline their data management processes.



# BENEFITS OF USING JPDB
JsonPowerDB (JPDB) has several unique features that set it apart from other databases:

1.  Proprietary algorithm for High Performance CRUD operations: JPDB is designed with a proprietary algorithm for High Performance CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This algorithm makes JPDB multiple times faster than popular DBMS.

2.  Serverless support for faster development: JPDB has built-in serverless support that enables UI developers to develop complete dynamic applications. This feature significantly reduces the development time and effort required to create applications.

3.  Embedded caching for lightning-fast performance: JPDB has built-in web/application server and embedded caching, which makes the performance lightning fast. This feature enhances the database's performance and responsiveness, resulting in a better user experience.

4.  Server-side Native NoSQL: JPDB is a server-side Native NoSQL database, which provides the best query performance. This feature is useful for applications that require real-time data processing and analysis.

5.  Multi-mode DBMS: JPDB supports multiple modes, including Document DB, Key-Value DB, and RDBMS. This feature allows developers to use the database for different types of applications, depending on their specific requirements.

6.  Schema-free: JPDB is schema-free, which means it is easy to develop and maintain. This feature eliminates the need for complex data modeling and database schema design, reducing the development time and effort.

7.  Pluggable API Framework: JPDB is enriched by a pluggable API framework that enables developers to develop a pluggable API and plugin into any of our cloud JPDB instances. This feature makes JPDB highly extensible and customizable.

8.  Standardisation of API development framework: JPDB has a standardized API development framework that makes the development process easy, more readable, and less error-prone. This feature enhances the database's usability and reduces the likelihood of errors and bugs.

9.  Multiple security layers: JPDB has multiple security layers to ensure data security and protection. This feature provides developers and users with peace of mind knowing that their data is safe and secure.

10. Nimble, Simple to use, In-Memory, Real-time DBMS: JPDB is nimble, simple to use, and in-memory, making it a real-time DBMS that is ideal for use in applications that require fast data processing and analysis. This feature provides developers with the flexibility and speed they need to develop high-performance applications.s.
